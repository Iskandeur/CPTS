Once we identify the services running on ports identified from our `Nmap` scan, the first step is to look if any of the applications/services have any public exploits. Public exploits can be found for web applications and other applications running on open ports, like `SSH` or `ftp`.

## Finding Public Exploits

Many tools can help us search for public exploits for the various applications and services we may encounter during the enumeration phase. One way is to Google for the application name with `exploit` to see if we get any results:

![Google search results for 'Windows 7 SMB exploit' showing links to EternalBlue exploit articles.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/google_smb.jpg)

A well-known tool for this purpose is `searchsploit`, which we can use to search for public vulnerabilities/exploits for any application. We can install it with the following command:

```shell-session
Iskandeur@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install exploitdb -y
```

Then, we can use `searchsploit` to search for a specific application by its name, as follows:

```shell-session
Iskandeur@htb[/htb]$ searchsploit openssh 7.2

We can also utilize online exploit databases to search for vulnerabilities, like [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com), [Rapid7 DB](https://www.rapid7.com/db/), or [Vulnerability Lab](https://www.vulnerability-lab.com). The [Intro to Web Applications](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/75) module discusses public vulnerabilities for web applications.
## Metasploit Primer

The [[Metasploit Framework (MSF)]] is an excellent tool for pentesters. It contains many built-in exploits for many public vulnerabilities and provides an easy way to use these exploits against vulnerable targets. MSF has many other features, like:

- Running reconnaissance scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets
    
- Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerability without actually compromising the target
    
- Meterpreter, which is a great tool to connect to shells and run commands on the compromised targets
    
- Many post-exploitation and pivoting tools
    

For examples, check [[Metasploit Framework (MSF)]]

Later on, in this module, we will walk through the `Nibbles` box step-by-step and then show exploitation using `Metasploit`. `Metasploit` is another essential tool to add to our toolkit, but it is crucial not solely to rely on it. To be well-rounded testers, we must know how to best leverage all of the tools available to us, understand why they sometimes fail, and know when to pivot to manual techniques or other tools.
