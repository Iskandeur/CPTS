# Pre-Engagement
Pre-engagement is the stage of preparation for the actual penetration test. During this stage, many questions are asked, and some contractual agreements are made. The client informs us about what they want to be tested, and we explain in detail how to make the test as efficient as possible.

Three essential components:
1. Scoping questionnaire
2. Pre-engagement meeting
3. Kick-off meeting

Before this, a NDA must be signed by all parties. Several types exist:
- Unilateral: only one party has to maintain confidentiality (the other is allowed to share)
- Bilateral NDA: both parties are obligated to keep the resulting and acquired information confidential. Most common type to protect the work of pentesters.
- Multilateral NDA: commitment to confidentiality by more than two parties. E.g. for a cooperative network.

Exceptions can be made in urgent cases (jump into the kick-off meeting, via videoconference for example).
Be careful to know who in the company is permitted to contract us for a penetration test.
