# Pre-Engagement

## Overview
- Preparation stage for actual penetration test
- Involves client communication and contractual agreements

- Pentester explains testing methodology

## Essential Components
- Scoping questionnaire

## NDA Types
- Unilateral: Only one party maintains confidentiality

##### Documents
|**Document**|**Timing for Creation**|
|---|---|
|`1. Non-Disclosure Agreement` (`NDA`)|`After` Initial Contact|
|`2. Scoping Questionnaire`|`Before` the Pre-Engagement Meeting|
|`3. Scoping Document`|`During` the Pre-Engagement Meeting|
|`4. Penetration Testing Proposal` (`Contract/Scope of Work` (`SoW`))|`During` the Pre-engagement Meeting|

|`6. Contractors Agreement` (Physical Assessments)|`Before` the Kick-Off Meeting|
|`7. Reports`|`During` and `after` the conducted Penetration Test|
>Note: Our client may provide a separate scoping document listing in-scope IP addresses/ranges/URLs and any necessary credentials but this information should also be documented as an appendix in the RoE document.

>**Important Note:** These documents should be reviewed and adapted by a lawyer after they have been prepared.

## Scoping Questionnaire
After initial contact, we send it to the client to better understand the services they are seeking.
Should clearly explain our services.
May typically ask them to choose one or more from this list:
- Internal Vulnerability Assessment
- External Vulnerability Assessment
- Internal Penetration Test
- External Penetration Test
- Wireless Security Assessment
- Application Security Assessment
- Physical Security Assessment
- Social Engineering Assessment
- Red Team Assessment
- Web Application Security Assessment

Each choice need sub-choices, allowing the client to be more specific.
>Do they need a web application or mobile application assessment? Secure code review? Should the Internal Penetration Test be black box and semi-evasive? Do they want just a phishing assessment as part of the Social Engineering Assessment or also vishing calls?

This is our chance to explain the depth of our services.

Aside from the assessment type, client name, address, and key personnel contact information, some other critical pieces of information include:

- How many expected live hosts?
- How many IPs/CIDR ranges in scope?
- How many Domains/Subdomains are in scope?
- How many wireless SSIDs in scope?
- How many web/mobile applications? If testing is authenticated, how many roles (standard user, admin, etc.)?
- For a phishing assessment, how many users will be targeted? Will the client provide a list, or we will be required to gather this list via OSINT?
- If the client is requesting a Physical Assessment, how many locations? If multiple sites are in-scope, are they geographically dispersed?
- What is the objective of the Red Team Assessment? Are any activities (such as phishing or physical security attacks) out of scope?
- Is a separate Active Directory Security Assessment desired?
- Will network testing be conducted from an anonymous user on the network or a standard domain user?
- Do we need to bypass Network Access Control (NAC)?

Then, we talk about:
