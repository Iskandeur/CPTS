>Note: Our client may provide a separate scoping document listing in-scope IP addresses/ranges/URLs and any necessary credentials but this information should also be documented as an appendix in the RoE document.

>**Important Note:** These documents should be reviewed and adapted by a lawyer after they have been prepared.

## Scoping Questionnaire
After initial contact, we send it to the client to better understand the services they are seeking.
Should clearly explain our services.
May typically ask them to choose one or more from this list:
- Internal Vulnerability Assessment
- External Vulnerability Assessment
- Internal Penetration Test
- External Penetration Test
- Wireless Security Assessment
- Application Security Assessment
- Physical Security Assessment
- Social Engineering Assessment
- Red Team Assessment
- Web Application Security Assessment

Each choice need sub-choices, allowing the client to be more specific.
>Do they need a web application or mobile application assessment? Secure code review? Should the Internal Penetration Test be black box and semi-evasive? Do they want just a phishing assessment as part of the Social Engineering Assessment or also vishing calls?

This is our chance to explain the depth of our services.

Aside from the assessment type, client name, address, and key personnel contact information, some other critical pieces of information include:

- How many expected live hosts?
- How many IPs/CIDR ranges in scope?
- How many Domains/Subdomains are in scope?
- How many wireless SSIDs in scope?
- How many web/mobile applications? If testing is authenticated, how many roles (standard user, admin, etc.)?
- For a phishing assessment, how many users will be targeted? Will the client provide a list, or we will be required to gather this list via OSINT?
- If the client is requesting a Physical Assessment, how many locations? If multiple sites are in-scope, are they geographically dispersed?
- What is the objective of the Red Team Assessment? Are any activities (such as phishing or physical security attacks) out of scope?
- Is a separate Active Directory Security Assessment desired?
- Will network testing be conducted from an anonymous user on the network or a standard domain user?
- Do we need to bypass Network Access Control (NAC)?

Then, we talk about:
- Disclosure: Is the Penetration Test black box (no information provided), grey box (only IP address/CIDR ranges/URLs provided), white box (detailed information provided)
- Evasiveness: Would they like us to test from a non-evasive, hybrid-evasive (start quiet and gradually become "louder" to assess at what level the client's security personnel detect our activities), or fully evasive.

All these infos will help us to make an accurate project timeline proposal.
We sum-up everything into the Scoping Document.
## Pre-Engagement Meeting
Once we have an initial idea, we move on to this meeting.
This meeting discusses all relevant and essential components with the customer before the penetration test, explaining them to our customer.
The information we gather during this phase, along with the data collected from the scoping questionnaire, will serve as inputs to the `Penetration Testing Proposal`, also known as the `Contract` or `Scope of Work` (`SoW`). 
>We can think of the whole process as a visit to the doctor to inform ourselves regarding the planned examinations. 

This phase typically occurs via e-mail and during an online conference call or in-person meeting.

| `☐ NDA`                              | Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) refers to a secrecy contract between the client and the contractor regarding all written or verbal information concerning an order/project. The contractor agrees to treat all confidential information brought to its attention as strictly confidential, even after the order/project is completed. Furthermore, any exceptions to confidentiality, the transferability of rights and obligations, and contractual penalties shall be stipulated in the agreement. The NDA should be signed before the kick-off meeting or at the latest during the meeting before any information is discussed in detail. |
| `☐ Goals`                            | Goals are milestones that must be achieved during the order/project. In this process, goal setting is started with the significant goals and continued with fine-grained and small ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `☐ Scope`                            | The individual components to be tested are discussed and defined. These may include domains, IP ranges, individual hosts, specific accounts, security systems, etc. Our customers may expect us to find out one or the other point by ourselves. However, the legal basis for testing the individual components has the highest priority here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `☐ Penetration Testing Type`         | When choosing the type of penetration test, we present the individual options and explain the advantages and disadvantages. Since we already know the goals and scope of our customers, we can and should also make a recommendation on what we advise and justify our recommendation accordingly. Which type is used in the end is the client's decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `☐ Methodologies`                    | Examples: OSSTMM, OWASP, automated and manual unauthenticated analysis of the internal and external network components, vulnerability assessments of network components and web applications, vulnerability threat vectorization, verification and exploitation, and exploit development to facilitate evasion techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `☐ Penetration Testing Locations`    | External: Remote (via secure VPN) and/or Internal: Internal or Remote (via secure VPN)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `☐ Time Estimation`                  | For the time estimation, we need the start and the end date for the penetration test. This gives us a precise time window to perform the test and helps us plan our procedure. It is also vital to explicitly ask how time windows the individual attacks (Exploitation / Post-Exploitation / Lateral Movement) are to be carried out. These can be carried out during or outside regular working hours. When testing outside regular working hours, the focus is more on the security solutions and systems that should withstand our attacks.                                                                                             |
| `☐ Third Parties`                    | For the third parties, it must be determined via which third-party providers our customer obtains services. These can be cloud providers, ISPs, and other hosting providers. Our client must obtain written consent from these providers describing that they agree and are aware that certain parts of their service will be subject to a simulated hacking attack. It is also highly advisable to require the contractor to forward the third-party permission sent to us so that we have actual confirmation that this permission has indeed been obtained.                                                                              |
| `☐ Evasive Testing`                  | Evasive testing is the test of evading and passing security traffic and security systems in the customer's infrastructure. We look for techniques that allow us to find out information about the internal components and attack them. It depends on whether our contractor wants us to use such techniques or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `☐ Risks`                            | We must also inform our client about the risks involved in the tests and the possible consequences. Based on the risks and their potential severity, we can then set the limitations together and take certain precautions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `☐ Scope Limitations & Restrictions` | It is also essential to determine which servers, workstations, or other network components are essential for the client's proper functioning and its customers. We will have to avoid these and must not influence them any further, as this could lead to critical technical errors that could also affect our client's customers in production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `☐ Information Handling`             | HIPAA, PCI, HITRUST, FISMA/NIST, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `☐ Contact Information`              | For the contact information, we need to create a list of each person's name, title, job title, e-mail address, phone number, office phone number, and an escalation priority order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `☐ Lines of Communication`           | It should also be documented which communication channels are used to exchange information between the customer and us. This may involve e-mail correspondence, telephone calls, or personal meetings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `☐ Reporting`                        | Apart from the report's structure, any customer-specific requirements the report should contain are also discussed. In addition, we clarify how the reporting is to take place and whether a presentation of the results is desired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `☐ Payment Terms`                    | Finally, prices and the terms of payment are explained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The most crucial element of this meeting is the detailed presentation of the penetration test to our client and its focus. As we already know, each piece of infrastructure is unique for the most part, and each client has particular preferences on which they place the most importance. Finding out these priorities is an essential part of this meeting.

>We can think of it as ordering in a restaurant. If we want a medium-rare steak and the chef gives us a well-done steak because he believes it is better, it will not be what we were hoping for. Therefore, we should prioritize our client's wishes and serve the steak as they ordered.

Based on the `Contract Checklist` and the input information shared in scoping, the `Penetration Testing Proposal` (`Contract`) and the associated `Rules of Engagement` (`RoE`) are created.

## Kick-Off Meeting
The kick-off meeting usually occurs at a scheduled time and in-person after signing all contractual documents.
>Features: client POC(s) (from Internal Audit, Information Security, IT, Governance & Risk, etc., depending on the client), client technical support staff (developers, sysadmins, network engineers, etc.), and the penetration testing team (someone in a management role (such as the Practice Lead), the actual penetration tester(s), and sometimes a Project Manager or even the Sales Account Executive or similar)

We also explain that if a critical vulnerability is identified, penetration testing activities will be paused, a vulnerability notification report will be generated, and the emergency contacts will be contacted.
>Typically for an RCE or a SQLi, to allow client to do an emergency fix if necessary

Typical reasons to stop a pentest:
* A system becomes unresponsive
* Evidence of illegal activities
* External Threat Actor detected

We mutst inform customer of the risks, such as:
- a lot of potential noise in the logs and potential alerts / alarms.
- if bruteforce used, potential account lock
they have to inform us immediately if the performed pentest negatively impacts their network

Be mindful of the audience, explain to everyone.
All points related to testing need to be discussed and clarified.
Adapt to the customer.

## Contractors Agreement
if included physical testing, additional contractor's agreement required.
This is, because we go out of the virtual world and a whole new set of laws apply
It's our _get out of jail free_ card, in case we get caught in a physical intrusion.

## Setting Up
Then we start to work and prepare the environment, VMs, VPS, and other tools needed for different scenarios.

# Information Gathering
Starts when pre-engagement is completed. Everyone signed everything, we can begin to work.
**Information gathering is the most frequent and vital phase throughout the penetration testing process, to which we will return again and again.**

All the actions we are going to take against the victim will be based on the info we get during this phase.
Many ways possible, 4 categories:
* Open-Source Intelligence
- Infrastructure Enumeration
- Service Enumeration
- Host Enumeration

All 4 _should_ be used during each pentest.

Information is the key. It is spread everywhere and we have to go for it.
