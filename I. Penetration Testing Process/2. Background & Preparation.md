# A. Penetration Testing Overview
## Pentest vs Red Teaming vs Vulnerability Assessment
* In a `pentest`, the goal is to uncover ALL vulnerabilities in the scope to improve security for the tested systems.
* In a `red team` assessment, the process is scenario-based, and focus on vulnerabilities leveraged to reach a specific goal. (e.g. accessing the CEO's inbox)
* In a `vulnerability assesment`,  purely automated tools are used.

## Risk Management
Generally speaking, a pentest is included in a company strategy of `risk management`.
Main goal of IT security risk management:
* identify
* evaluate
* mitigate
any potential risks that could damage
* confidentiality
* integrity
* availability
of an organization's information systems and data,
And reduce the overall risk to an acceptable level.
