## Pentest vs Red Teaming

- A Penetration Test (Pentest) is an organized, targeted, and authorized attack attempt to test IT infrastructure and its defenders to determine their susceptibility to IT security vulnerabilities.
- A pentest aims to uncover and identify ALL vulnerabilities in the systems under investigation and improve the security for the tested systems
- Other assessments, such as a red team assessment, may be scenario-based and focus on only the vulnerabilities leveraged to reach a specific end goal (i.e., accessing the CEO's email inbox or obtaining a flag planted on a critical server).
