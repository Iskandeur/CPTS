# A. Penetration Testing Overview
## Pentest vs Red Teaming vs Vulnerability Assessment
* In a `red team` assessment, the process is scenario-based, and focus on vulnerabilities leveraged to reach a specific goal. (e.g. accessing the CEO's inbox)
* In a `pentest`, the goal is to uncover ALL vulnerabilities in the scope to improve security for the tested systems.
* In a `vulnerability assesment`, purely automated tools are used.

For both pentest and va, a mutual agreement is needed. If not, it is a criminal offense.
## Risk Management
Generally speaking, a pentest is included in a company strategy of `risk management`.
Main goal of IT security risk management:
* identify
* evaluate
* mitigate
any potential risks that could damage
* confidentiality
* integrity
* availability
of an organization's information systems and data,
And reduce the overall risk to an acceptable level.

Risk can be transfered to other parties by a contract.
## Testing Methods
### External
Perspective of an anonymous user on the Internet. What most of customers want, to be ensured against attacks on the external network perimeter.

Stealth: some clients don't care at all, others prefer an hybrid approach, with increased noise, to test their detection capabilities.

To avoid being blocked by our ISP, we can use a VPN connection or a VPS

Goal: access external-facing hosts, obtain sensitive data, or gain access to the internal network
### Internal
In contrast, from within the corporate network. 
May be executed: 
- after successfully penetrating the corporate network via the external pentest
- starting from an assumed breach scenario
May also request access to isolated systems with no internet access whatsoever, which usually requires physical presence.
## Types of Penetration Testing
Determines how much information is made available ot us.
- **Blackbox:** Minimal. Only the essential information, such as IP addresses and domains, is provided.
- **Greybox:** Extended. In this case, we are provided with additional information, such as specific URLs, hostnames, subnets, and similar.
- **Whitebox:** Maximum. Here everything is disclosed to us. This gives us an internal view of the entire structure, which allows us to prepare an attack using internal information. We may be given detailed configurations, admin credentials, web application source code, etc.
- **Red-Teaming:** May include physical testing and social engineering, among other things. Can be combined with any of the above types.
- **Purple-Teaming:** It can be combined with any of the above types. However, it focuses on working closely with the defenders.
## Types of Testing Environments

# A. Laws and Regulations
You have to comply to the laws for computer-related activities, copyright protection, interception of electronic communications, use and disclosure of protected health information, and collection of personal information from children, respectively.
We must be aware of them or face a risk of civil / criminal penalties.
