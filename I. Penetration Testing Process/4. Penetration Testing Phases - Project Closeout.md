# Proof-of-Concept
For us in information security, this is where we prove vulnerabilities in operating systems or application software.

We use this PoC to prove that a security problem exists so that the developers or administrators can validate it, reproduce it, see the impact, and test their remediation efforts. One of the most common examples used to prove software vulnerabilities is executing the calculator (calc.exe on Windows) on the target system. In principle, the PoC also assesses the probability of success of system access from actual exploitation.

Can be:
- documentation
- script
- code

It is important for the administrators to understand that the goal is not to make the PoC-script fail, as the same vulnerability can be used in a different way, but rather to fix the root of the problem, the vulnerability itself.

>The report they receive from us should help them see the entire picture, focus on the broader issues, and provide clear remediation advice. Including an attack chain walkthrough in the event of domain compromise during an internal is a great way to show how multiple flaws can be combined and how fixing one flaw will break the chain, but the other flaws will still exist. If these are not also fixed, there may be another path to get to the point where the attack chain was remediated and continue onwards. We should also drive this point home during our report review meeting.

For example, if a user uses the password `Password123`, the underlying vulnerability is not the password but the `password policy`. If a Domain Admin is found to be using that password and it is changed, that one account will now have a stronger password, but the problem of weak passwords will likely still be endemic within the organization.

# Post-Engagement
Like before the pentest itself, there is several things to do after it.
## Cleanup
- Deleting scripts or tool uploaded to the target IS
- Reverting changes in configuration
This should be easy if we did take notes during the penetration process.

If we cannot access a system where an artifact needs to be deleted, or another change reverted, we should alert the client and list these issues in the report appendices. Even if we can remove any uploaded files and revert changes (such as adding a local admin account), we should document these changes in our report appendices in case the client receives alerts that they need to follow up on and confirm that the activity in question was part of our sanctioned testing.

# Documentation and Reporting
Before closing all connections to the client's network, we have to make sure we have all the necessary material for all findings we wish to include in ou report.
This includes command output, screenshots, a listing of affected hosts, and anything else specific to the client environment or finding.

We should not keep any Personal Identifiable Information (PII), potentially incriminating info, or other sensitive data we came across throughout testing.

We should already have a detailed list of the findings we will include in the report and all necessary details to tailor the findings to the client's environment. Our report deliverable (which is covered in detail in the [Documentation & Reporting](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/162) module) should consist of the following:

- An attack chain (in the event of full internal compromise or external to internal access) detailing steps taken to achieve compromise
- A strong executive summary that a non-technical audience can understand
- Detailed findings specific to the client's environment that include a risk rating, finding impact, remediation recommendations, and high-quality external references related to the issue
- Adequate steps to reproduce each finding so the team responsible for remediation can understand and test the issue while putting fixes in place
- Near, medium, and long-term recommendations specific to the environment
- Appendices which include information such as the target scope, OSINT data (if relevant to the engagement), password cracking analysis (if relevant), discovered ports/services, compromised hosts, compromised accounts, files transferred to client-owned systems, any account creation/system modifications, an Active Directory security analysis (if relevant), relevant scan data/supplementary documentation, and any other information necessary to explain a specific finding or recommendation further

At this point we have a draft, then comes
## Report Review Meeting
Once the draft report is delivered, and the client has had a chance to distribute it internally and review it in-depth, it is customary to hold a report review meeting to walk through the assessment results. The report review meeting typically includes the same folks from the client and the firm performing the assessment. Depending on the types of findings, the client may bring in additional technical subject matter experts if the finding is related to a system or application they are responsible for. Typically we will not read the entire report word for word but walk through each finding briefly and give an explanation from our own perspective/experience. The client will have the opportunity to ask questions about anything in the report, ask for clarifications, or point out issues that need to be corrected. Often the client will come with a list of questions about specific findings and will not want to cover every finding in detail (such as low-risk ones).

## Deliverable Acceptance
DRAFT = ask for client's feedback
FINAL = final.

Some audit firms may not accept DRAFT.
## Post-Remediation Testing
