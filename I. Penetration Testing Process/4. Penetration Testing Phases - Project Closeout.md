# Proof-of-Concept
For us in information security, this is where we prove vulnerabilities in operating systems or application software.

We use this PoC to prove that a security problem exists so that the developers or administrators can validate it, reproduce it, see the impact, and test their remediation efforts. One of the most common examples used to prove software vulnerabilities is executing the calculator (calc.exe on Windows) on the target system. In principle, the PoC also assesses the probability of success of system access from actual exploitation.

Can be:
- documentation
- script
- code

It is important for the administrators to understand that the goal is not to make the PoC-script fail, as the same vulnerability can be used in a different way, but rather to fix the root of the problem, the vulnerability itself.
