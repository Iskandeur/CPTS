# Proof-of-Concept
For us in information security, this is where we prove vulnerabilities in operating systems or application software.

We use this PoC to prove that a security problem exists so that the developers or administrators can validate it, reproduce it, see the impact, and test their remediation efforts. One of the most common examples used to prove software vulnerabilities is executing the calculator (calc.exe on Windows) on the target system. In principle, the PoC also assesses the probability of success of system access from actual exploitation.

Can be:
- documentation
- script
- code

It is important for the administrators to understand that the goal is not to make the PoC-script fail, as the same vulnerability can be used in a different way, but rather to fix the root of the problem, the vulnerability itself.

>The report they receive from us should help them see the entire picture, focus on the broader issues, and provide clear remediation advice. Including an attack chain walkthrough in the event of domain compromise during an internal is a great way to show how multiple flaws can be combined and how fixing one flaw will break the chain, but the other flaws will still exist. If these are not also fixed, there may be another path to get to the point where the attack chain was remediated and continue onwards. We should also drive this point home during our report review meeting.

For example, if a user uses the password `Password123`, the underlying vulnerability is not the password but the `password policy`. If a Domain Admin is found to be using that password and it is changed, that one account will now have a stronger password, but the problem of weak passwords will likely still be endemic within the organization.

# Post-Engagement
Like before the pentest itself, there is several things to do after it.
## Cleanup
- Deleting scripts or tool uploaded to the target IS
- Reverting changes in configuration
