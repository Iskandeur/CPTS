Part of the [[Vulnerability Assessment]] phase.

Involves searching for known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, exploits, and security weaknesses associated with the systems, services, and software versions identified during [[Information Gathering]].

## Goal

- Identify documented vulnerabilities ([[CVE]]) relevant to the target environment.
- Find publicly available [[Proof-of-Concept (PoC)]] exploit code.
- Understand the conditions required for a vulnerability to be exploitable.

## Process

1.  Use information from [[Service Enumeration]] and [[Host Enumeration]] (software names, versions, OS details).
2.  Query vulnerability databases and resources using this information.
3.  Analyze findings to determine applicability to the target environment.
4.  Investigate any found [[Proof-of-Concept (PoC)]] code.

## Key Resources

*   [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)]] list: [cve.org](https://www.cve.org/)
*   National Vulnerability Database ([[NVD]]): [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
*   Exploit Database ([[Exploit DB]]): [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com)
*   [CVEdetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/)
*   [Vulners](https://vulners.com)
*   [Packet Storm Security](https://packetstormsecurity.com)
*   Vendor Security Advisories
*   GitHub (for PoCs)
*   Search Engines (Google, etc.)

## Analysis of Findings

- Apply [[Analysis Types]], particularly `Diagnostic Analysis`, to understand *why* a vulnerability exists and how a [[Proof-of-Concept (PoC)]] works.
- Apply `Predictive Analysis` to assess the likelihood of exploit success in the specific target environment.
- **Crucially:** Published [[Proof-of-Concept (PoC)]] code often requires modification to work against a specific target due to differences in configuration, OS, or environment. Do not assume a public PoC will work out-of-the-box.
