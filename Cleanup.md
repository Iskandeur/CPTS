Part of the [[Post-Engagement Phase]].

Actions taken by the pentester to remove artifacts and revert changes made during the [[Penetration Test]].

## Goal

- Return the client environment to its original state (as much as feasible).
- Remove any tools, scripts, payloads, or accounts created by the testing team.
- Avoid leaving unintended backdoors or security risks.

## Actions

- Deleting scripts or tools uploaded to target systems.
- Reverting configuration changes made (e.g., firewall rules, service settings) - *if* changes were made and approved.
- Removing any created user accounts (local or domain).
- Deleting [[Persistence]] mechanisms established.
- Clearing logs *only if explicitly required and approved* (generally discouraged as logs are valuable for client correlation).
- Removing staged [[Data Exfiltration]] files.

## Importance of Notes

Thorough note-taking during the engagement is crucial for effective cleanup. Keep track of:
- Files uploaded (and paths).
- Accounts created.
- Configurations modified.
- Systems accessed.
- [[Persistence]] methods used.

## Client Communication

- If unable to access a system to remove an artifact or revert a change, **alert the client immediately**.
- Document all cleanup actions (successful or unsuccessful) in the final [[Reporting]] appendices.
- This helps the client correlate any alerts or logs generated by cleanup activities.
- Even if cleanup is successful, document changes made (like account creation) in the report appendices for client awareness.
