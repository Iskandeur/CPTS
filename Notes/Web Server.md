## Definition

- **Definition:** Backend software (e.g., [[Apache]], [[Nginx]], [[IIS]]) that handles [[HTTP]]/[[HTTPS]] requests from client browsers.
- **Function:** Receives requests, routes them to the appropriate [[Web Application]] component or static file, and sends back responses.
- **Common Ports:** Typically listens on [[TCP]] port `80` ([[HTTP]]) and `443` ([[HTTPS]]), but can be configured on non-standard ports.
- **Security Importance:** As web applications are often internet-facing, vulnerabilities in the web server software itself or the applications it hosts can lead to compromise of the backend server and potentially the internal network.
