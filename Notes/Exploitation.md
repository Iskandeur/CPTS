A core phase in [[Penetration Testing]], following [[Vulnerability Assessment]].

This phase involves attempting to actively leverage identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or achieve specific objectives.

## Goal

- Gain a foothold on the target system(s).
- Escalate privileges.
- Achieve the objectives defined in the [[Rules of Engagement (RoE)]] (e.g., access specific data, compromise specific accounts).

## Process

1.  **Prioritize Attacks:** Select vulnerabilities identified in [[Vulnerability Assessment]] based on factors like probability of success ([[CVSS]]), complexity, and potential impact/damage. See [[Exploit Prioritization]].
2.  **Prepare Exploit:** Adapt [[Proof-of-Concept (PoC)]] code or develop custom exploits tailored to the target environment. See [[Exploit Development]].
3.  **Execute Exploit:** Run the prepared exploit against the target.
4.  **Validate Success:** Confirm if the exploit was successful (e.g., received a shell, gained access, achieved objective).

## Relationship with Other Phases

- Relies heavily on inputs from [[Information Gathering]] and [[Vulnerability Assessment]].
- Successful exploitation leads into the [[Post-Exploitation]] phase.
- May involve iteration; if an exploit fails, may need to return to [[Vulnerability Assessment]] or [[Information Gathering]].

## Important Distinction

While [[Vulnerability Assessment]] identifies weaknesses, Exploitation *actively attempts to leverage* them. Preparation and execution are key parts of this phase.
