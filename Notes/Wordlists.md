# Wordlists

Wordlists are text files containing lists of words, phrases, usernames, passwords, paths, potential subdomain names, or other data points. They are fundamental resources used in various penetration testing activities, particularly for brute-forcing and enumeration tasks.

## Common Uses

*   Password Cracking (e.g., with John the Ripper, Hashcat)
*   Directory/File Enumeration ([[GoBuster]], `ffuf`, `dirb`)
*   Subdomain Enumeration ([[GoBuster]], `ffuf`)
*   Parameter Fuzzing
*   Username Enumeration

## Sources

*   [[SecLists]] (Highly recommended collection)
*   Default lists included with tools (e.g., Kali Linux `/usr/share/wordlists`)
*   Generating custom lists (e.g., using `CeWL`)
*   Online repositories
