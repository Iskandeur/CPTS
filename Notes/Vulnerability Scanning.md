# Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is the process of proactively identifying security weaknesses (vulnerabilities) in systems, networks, and applications.

It is distinct from a full [[Penetration Testing Process|penetration test]], which usually involves attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities. Scanning focuses on identification and reporting.

## Types of Scanners

*   **Network-based scanners:** Scan for open ports, services, and known vulnerabilities on network hosts (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys).
*   **Host-based scanners:** Run locally on a host to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or missing patches.
*   **Web application scanners:** Focus specifically on identifying vulnerabilities in web applications (e.g., Burp Suite Scanner, Nikto, OWASP ZAP).

## Tools

*   Nessus
*   OpenVAS / Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM)
*   Qualys
*   Nikto
*   [[Nmap]] (specifically using [[Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)|NSE]] scripts in the `vuln` category)
*   Burp Suite (Scanner component)
*   OWASP ZAP (Scanner component)
