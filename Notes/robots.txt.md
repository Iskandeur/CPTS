## Purpose and Enumeration

It is common for websites to contain a `robots.txt` file, whose purpose is to instruct search engine web crawlers (like Googlebot) which resources they can and cannot access for indexing. During [[Web Enumeration]], analyzing the `robots.txt` file can provide valuable clues about the website's structure, potentially revealing hidden directories, administrative interfaces, or sensitive files that are not meant for public discovery.

**Example:**

In this case, we see that the `robots.txt` file contains two disallowed entries:

![Robots.txt file disallowing access to /private and /uploaded_files for all user agents.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/robots.png)

Navigating to `/private` in a browser might reveal restricted content, such as the HTB admin login page shown below:

![Login form with fields for username and password, and a login button.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/academy.png)
