A core phase in [[Penetration Testing]], occurring after successful [[Exploitation]].

This phase focuses on activities performed *after* gaining initial access to a system or network.

## Goal

- Understand the compromised system and its role.
- Gather further information from an internal perspective.
- Increase privileges ([[Privilege Escalation]]).
- Establish [[Persistence]].
- Move laterally to other systems ([[Lateral Movement]]).
- Identify and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data ([[Data Exfiltration]]) to demonstrate impact.
- Achieve the overall objectives of the [[Penetration Test]].

## Key Components / Sub-Phases

*(Often iterative and overlapping)*

- [[Evasive Testing]] (Consideration throughout)
- [[Information Gathering]] (Internal perspective)
- [[Pillaging]]
- [[Vulnerability Assessment]] (Internal perspective)
- [[Privilege Escalation]]
- [[Persistence]]
- [[Data Exfiltration]]
- [[Lateral Movement]] (Often considered its own major phase, but starts here)

## Importance

Post-exploitation demonstrates the *impact* of the initial compromise. Simply gaining access is often not the end goal; understanding what an attacker can *do* with that access is critical.
