Part of the [[Exploitation]] phase.

Involves selecting which identified vulnerabilities to attempt to exploit first.

## Factors

- **Probability of Success:** 
    - How likely is the exploit to work against this specific target?
    - Often estimated using [[CVSS]] scores (especially Exploitability metrics) and vulnerability details.
    - Consider the reliability of the [[Proof-of-Concept (PoC)]] or exploit technique.
    - Can be assessed using the [[NVD]] calculator: [nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)
- **Complexity:**
    - How much effort is required to prepare and execute the exploit?
    - Requires adapting [[Proof-of-Concept (PoC)]], [[Exploit Development]], specific configurations?
    - Relies on pentester experience.
    - Can be categorized (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Probability of Damage / Risk:**
    - What is the likelihood of causing unintended harm (e.g., system crash, data corruption, detection) by attempting the exploit?
    - Exploits targeting sensitive or unstable systems carry higher risk.
    - Buffer overflows, kernel exploits often riskier than web application flaws.

## Example Scoring

*(This is just one way to quantify; methodology can vary)*

| Factor                    | Points    | Example: RFI | Example: Buffer Overflow |
| :------------------------ | :-------- | :----------- | :----------------------- |
| 1. Probability of Success | `10`      | 10           | 8                        |
| 2. Complexity - Easy      | `5`       | 4            | 0                        |
| 3. Complexity - Medium    | `3`       | 0            | 3                        |
| 4. Complexity - Hard      | `1`       | 0            | 0                        |
| 5. Probability of Damage  | `-5`      | 0            | -5                       |
| **Summary**               | `max. 15` | 14           | 6                        |

*Based on this example, the Remote File Inclusion (RFI) would be prioritized due to higher success probability, lower complexity, and lower risk of damage.*

## Process

1.  List potential vulnerabilities from [[Vulnerability Assessment]].
2.  Evaluate each against the prioritization factors.
3.  Rank vulnerabilities based on the evaluation.
4.  Start exploit attempts with the highest-priority targets.
