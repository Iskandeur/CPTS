## IIS

Internet Information Services (IIS) is an extensible [[Web Server]] software created by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family. IIS supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SMTP and NNTP. It has been an integral part of the Windows NT family since Windows NT 4.0, although it may be absent from some editions (e.g. Windows XP Home edition), and is not active by default.
