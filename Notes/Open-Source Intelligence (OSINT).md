A category of [[Information Gathering]].

Involves collecting information from publicly available sources about a target organization and its employees.

## Goal

Find publicly accessible, potentially sensitive information without directly interacting with the target's systems.

## Potential Findings

- **Technical Data:** Domains, subdomains, IP ranges, technologies used, email addresses, usernames.
- **Employee Information:** Names, job titles, social media profiles, contact details.
- **Sensitive Leaks:** Passwords, API keys, tokens, internal documents accidentally exposed.
- **Infrastructure Details:** Cloud services used, hosting providers, DNS records.

## Importance

- Can yield quick wins (e.g., leaked credentials).
- Helps build a map of the target's external footprint.
- Provides context for [[Social Engineering]] attacks (e.g., phishing targets).
- Informs [[Infrastructure Enumeration]] and [[Host Enumeration]].

## Reporting Critical Findings

If highly sensitive information (credentials, keys) is found via OSINT early in the test, follow the incident handling procedures outlined in the [[Rules of Engagement (RoE)]] for reporting critical vulnerabilities.
