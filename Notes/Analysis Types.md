| `Predictive`  | Evaluates historical/current data to create predictive models for future probabilities. Identifies trends, detects deviations, and predicts future occurrences.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Predicting the likelihood of success for an [[Exploitation]] attempt. Assessing potential [[Attack Vectors]]. Simulating attacks in a mirrored environment to predict outcomes on the live target. Part of testing potential exploits and assessing the impact of vulnerabilities.                                                                                              |
| `Prescriptive`| Aims to determine what actions to take to eliminate/prevent a future problem or trigger a specific activity/process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Recommending remediation steps in the final [[Reporting]]. Suggesting configuration changes or patches to prevent exploitation. Determining the best [[Exploitation]] technique to use based on predicted success and potential impact. Guiding the next steps in the [[Penetration Testing Process]].                                                                                |
