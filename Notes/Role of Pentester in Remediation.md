A principle guiding pentester actions during the [[Post-Engagement Phase]], particularly regarding client fixes and [[Post-Remediation Testing]].

## Core Principle: Impartiality

Pentesters must remain **impartial third parties**.

## What Pentesters *Should* Do:

- **Provide Clear Recommendations:** Offer actionable advice in the [[Reporting|Report]] on *how* to fix vulnerabilities at a conceptual level (e.g., "sanitize user input to prevent [[SQL Injection (SQLi)]]", "implement proper access controls", "patch vulnerable software").
- **Provide High-Quality References:** Link to external resources ([[CVE]], [[OWASP]], vendor docs) that offer detailed remediation guidance.
- **Verify Fixes:** Perform [[Post-Remediation Testing]] to confirm if the client's implemented fix was effective.

## What Pentesters *Should NOT* Do:

- **Implement Changes Directly:** Pentesters should **not** make configuration changes or apply patches themselves on client systems.
- **Provide Specific Code/Commands:** Avoid giving exact code snippets or commands for remediation (e.g., don't rewrite the client's vulnerable code for them).
- **Recommend Specific Products:** Generally avoid recommending specific vendor solutions unless explicitly part of the engagement scope (maintain vendor neutrality).

## Rationale

- **Maintain Independence:** Ensures the integrity and objectivity of the assessment.
- **Avoid Conflict of Interest:** Prevents situations where the tester might be validating their own fix or recommendations.
- **Liability:** Avoids taking responsibility for potentially breaking systems during remediation attempts.
- **Empower Client:** The client owns their environment and the responsibility for fixing it; the pentester's role is to identify weaknesses and validate fixes.
