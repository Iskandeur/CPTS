Part of the [[Post-Engagement Phase]].

The formal process where the client acknowledges receipt and acceptance of the final [[Reporting|Report]].

## Process

1.  **Draft Report:** Delivered to client.
2.  **[[Report Review Meeting]]:** Held to discuss findings and address questions.
3.  **Final Report:** Tester incorporates any necessary factual corrections and delivers the final version.
4.  **Acceptance:** Client formally accepts the final report, signifying the main deliverable is complete.

## Draft vs. Final

- **DRAFT:** Clearly marked. Allows for client feedback and correction of factual errors.
- **FINAL:** The official record of the engagement after client review.
- *Note:* Some entities (e.g., audit firms) may only accept FINAL reports, not drafts, for compliance purposes.

## Importance

- Marks the completion of the primary reporting deliverable.
- Often triggers final invoicing or payment milestones.
- Confirms the client has received and understood the findings (though acceptance doesn't necessarily mean agreement with every interpretation).
