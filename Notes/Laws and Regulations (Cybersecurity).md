Legal frameworks governing computer access, data privacy, and electronic communications that penetration testers must be aware of and comply with.

**Failure to comply can result in severe civil and criminal penalties.**

## Importance for Pentesters

- Defines legal boundaries for testing activities.
- Highlights the need for explicit, written authorization ([[Scope of Work (SoW)]], [[Rules of Engagement (RoE)]]).
- Dictates how sensitive data (PII, PHI) discovered during tests must be handled ([[Data Retention]], [[Reporting]], [[Data Exfiltration]] procedures).
- Emphasizes the illegality of exceeding authorized scope or accessing systems without permission.

## [[Ethical Hacking Precautionary Measures]]

To operate within legal boundaries, always:
- Obtain explicit, **written authorization** before *any* testing.
- Strictly adhere to the defined **scope** and limitations.
- Take measures to **avoid unnecessary damage** or disruption.
- Handle discovered **personal/sensitive data** according to agreed procedures and legal requirements (do not access, use, or disclose without permission).
- Do **not intercept communications** without proper consent (as per ECPA, etc.).
- Ensure proper **authorization** before testing systems covered by specific regulations like HIPAA.
