# DNS Enumeration

DNS Enumeration is the process of identifying DNS records associated with a target domain. This is a crucial part of [[Information Gathering]] and can reveal valuable information about an organization's infrastructure.

## Techniques

*   Querying common record types (A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, SRV, CNAME)
*   Zone Transfers (AXFR)
*   Brute-forcing subdomains
*   Reverse DNS lookups
*   Using OSINT sources and search engines

## Tools

*   `dig`
*   `host`
*   `nslookup`
*   `dnsrecon`
*   `dnsenum`
*   `[[GoBuster]]` (`dns` mode)
*   `sublist3r`
*   `amass`
