The final administrative steps in the [[Post-Engagement Phase]].

## Goal

Ensure all contractual and procedural obligations are met to formally conclude the [[Penetration Test]] engagement.

## Key Actions

- **Final [[Cleanup]]:** Ensure all tester artifacts are removed and systems used for testing are wiped/destroyed as per [[Data Retention]] policy.
- **Secure [[Data Retention]]:** Confirm any required evidence is stored securely and encrypted.
- **Invoicing:** Send the final invoice to the client for services rendered.
- **Payment Collection:** Follow up on payment.
- **Client Satisfaction Survey:** Send a survey to gather feedback on the engagement.
    - Purpose: Identify areas of success and opportunities for improvement (company processes, individual consultant skills).
    - Helps improve future engagements.
- **Follow-on Discussions:** Potential discussions for future work if the client was satisfied.

## Importance of Soft Skills

> The client will usually remember interactions during the assessment, communication, and how they were treated/valued by the firm they engage, not the fancy exploit chain the pentester pulled off to pwn their systems.

- Professionalism, clear communication, and managing client interactions are crucial throughout the engagement, including the close-out.
- Use feedback for continuous improvement of both technical and soft skills.
