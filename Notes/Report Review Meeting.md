Part of the [[Post-Engagement Phase]], occurring after the draft [[Reporting|Report]] is delivered to the client.

## Purpose

- Allow the pentesting team to walk the client through the assessment results.
- Provide context and perspective beyond the written report.
- Give the client an opportunity to ask questions and seek clarification on findings, impact, or remediation.
- Identify any factual errors or misunderstandings in the draft report.

## Timing

- Scheduled after the client has had sufficient time to distribute and review the draft report internally.

## Attendees

- **Client:** Typically includes the original points of contact (POCs), potentially technical SMEs responsible for affected systems/applications, management.
- **Testing Firm:** Lead tester, possibly other testers involved, management/engagement manager.

## Process

- The testing team usually leads the meeting.
- Don't read the report verbatim.
- Briefly walk through each key finding, focusing on:
    - What the issue is.
    - The demonstrated impact in *their* environment.
    - High-level remediation concept.
- Address questions from the client (they often come prepared with specific questions).
- Be prepared to discuss findings in detail, but prioritize based on client interest (they may skip low-risk items).

## Outcome

- Shared understanding of the findings and risks.
- Client questions answered.
- Identification of any necessary corrections for the final report.
- Sets the stage for [[Deliverable Acceptance]].
