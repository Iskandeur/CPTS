Part of the [[Pre-Engagement Phase]].

This meeting formally starts the [[Penetration Test]] engagement.

## Timing

- Usually occurs at a scheduled time after signing all contractual documents ([[Penetration Testing Proposal]] / [[Contract]], [[Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)]], [[Rules of Engagement (RoE)]], [[Contractors Agreement]] if applicable).
- Often held in-person, but can be virtual.

## Attendees

- **Client:** Point(s) of Contact (POC) (e.g., Internal Audit, InfoSec, IT, GRC), technical support staff (developers, sysadmins, network engineers).
- **Testing Team:** Management/Lead, Penetration Tester(s), potentially Project Manager, Sales/Account Executive.

## Purpose

- Final review and confirmation of the [[Rules of Engagement (RoE)]].
- Ensure all parties understand the scope, objectives, timeline, and communication plan.
- Discuss critical vulnerability handling procedures (e.g., pausing test, immediate notification for [[Remote Code Execution (RCE)]] or [[SQL Injection (SQLi)]]).
- Explain potential risks and impacts (log noise, alerts, potential account lockouts from [[Brute Force]] attacks).
- Clarify process for client to report negative impacts from testing.
- Address any final questions.

## Key Considerations

- **Audience Awareness:** Explain technical details clearly for all attendees.
- **Adaptability:** Be prepared to adapt based on client feedback and concerns.
- **Stopping Conditions:** Clearly define reasons to pause or stop the test (e.g., system unresponsive, evidence of illegal activity, external threat actor detected).

## Outcome

- Official start of the testing window.
- All parties aligned on the plan and procedures.
