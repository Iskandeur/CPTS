An essential, non-technical skill for penetration testers, developed through [[Practice (Pentesting)|Practice]].

## Importance

- **Client Communication:** The [[Reporting|Report]] is often the primary deliverable. Clear documentation is crucial for the client to understand findings, impact, and required actions.
- **Credibility:** Well-documented findings with clear evidence build trust. Vague reports undermine the tester's work.
- **Impact Demonstration:** Effective documentation, including attack narratives, helps convey the real-world impact of vulnerabilities.
- **Knowledge Retention:** The act of documenting helps solidify understanding of technical concepts and attack paths.
- **Team Collaboration:** Clear notes facilitate handover and collaboration within a testing team.
- **Personal Reference:** Detailed notes from past engagements or practice labs serve as valuable personal knowledge bases for future encounters with similar systems or vulnerabilities.

## Key Aspects

- **Audience Awareness:** Tailor documentation to the intended audience.
    - **Technical Documentation:** Detailed steps, commands, code snippets, tool output for technical staff responsible for validation and remediation.
    - **Non-Technical Documentation:** Clear, concise summaries (like the Executive Summary in [[Reporting]]), impact statements, and high-level recommendations for management, avoiding deep technical jargon.
- **Clarity and Conciseness:** Be precise and avoid ambiguity. Get to the point, especially in non-technical sections.
- **Evidence:** Back up all assertions with clear, relevant evidence (screenshots, logs, output).
- **Reproducibility:** Provide clear steps for the client to reproduce findings.
- **Professionalism:** Use consistent formatting, proper grammar, and a professional tone.

## Practicing Documentation

- **During Practice Labs:** Don't just solve the box; take detailed notes *while* solving it.
- **Write Reports for Labs:** Create both technical and non-technical documentation based on notes from practice machines ([[Hack The Box (HTB)]] retired/active).
- **Compare and Refine:** Compare personal notes/reports with official or community write-ups to identify gaps or areas for improvement.
- **Seek Feedback:** Have technical and non-technical peers proofread practice documentation.
- **Simulate Client Meetings:** Practice explaining findings and recommendations verbally, simulating [[Report Review Meeting]] scenarios.
