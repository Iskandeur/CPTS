A core phase in [[Penetration Testing]], following [[Information Gathering]].

This phase involves examining and analyzing the information gathered previously to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Process

- **Analysis:** Review findings from [[Information Gathering]] ([[OSINT]], [[Infrastructure Enumeration]], [[Service Enumeration]], [[Host Enumeration]]). Apply different [[Analysis Types]] to understand the data.
- **[[Vulnerability Research]]:** Search for known vulnerabilities ([[CVE]]) associated with identified software versions, configurations, or architectures.
- **Assessment of Attack Vectors:** Identify and evaluate potential ways an attacker could exploit the discovered weaknesses.
- **Testing (Optional/Careful):** May involve carefully testing potential vulnerabilities, potentially in a mirrored environment first, especially if [[Evasive Testing]] is required.

## Key Activities

- Understanding what is known and unknown about the target.
- Drawing conclusions from gathered data.
- Correlating information from different sources.
- Identifying potential security weaknesses.

## Relationship with Information Gathering

These two phases often overlap and involve iteration. If vulnerability assessment doesn't reveal viable paths, return to [[Information Gathering]] to collect more data.

> **`A (real) Penetration Test is not a CTF.`** - Vulnerability assessment in a real pentest aims to identify *all* potential weaknesses, not just find the quickest path to exploitation.

*Note: Vulnerability Assessment also occurs during [[Post-Exploitation]] and [[Lateral Movement]], focusing on the internal perspective and locally discovered information.*
