Part of the [[Pre-Engagement Phase]].

This meeting occurs after the initial [[Scoping Questionnaire]] is reviewed and before the [[Penetration Test]] begins.

## Purpose

- Discuss all relevant and essential components with the customer before the penetration test.
- Explain the process and methodologies to the customer.
- Gather information (along with the scoping questionnaire) to serve as inputs for the [[Penetration Testing Proposal]] (also known as [[Contract]] or [[Scope of Work (SoW)]]).

> Analogy: Like visiting a doctor to discuss planned examinations.

## Format

Typically occurs via e-mail and during an online conference call or in-person meeting.
