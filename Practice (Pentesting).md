A fundamental aspect of becoming and remaining a skilled penetration tester.

## Importance

- **Skill Development:** Theory is insufficient without practical application. "Practice makes perfect."
- **Methodology Refinement:** Testing different environments reveals weaknesses and strengths in one's approach.
- **Tool Proficiency:** Builds familiarity and speed with essential tools.
- **[[Documentation Skills|Documentation]] Improvement:** Practice documenting findings clearly and concisely for different audiences.
- **Staying Current:** Reinforces understanding of new Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures ([[TTPs]]).

## Effective Practice Strategies

- **Varied Environments:** Practice on diverse targets (different OS, applications, network structures). [[Hack The Box (HTB)]] provides various options (Modules, Retired/Active Machines, Pro Labs).
- **Realistic Scenarios:** Engage with multi-host environments (like HTB Pro Labs) that simulate enterprise networks to practice [[Lateral Movement]], [[Pivoting]], and [[Active Directory]] attacks.
- **Focus on Documentation:** Actively practice writing both technical and non-technical documentation for exercises and challenges. Get feedback via proofreading.
- **Structured Approach:** Follow a plan (e.g., HTB modules -> retired machines -> active machines -> labs) to build foundational knowledge before tackling complex scenarios.
- **Learn from Others:** Review official write-ups, community write-ups, and video walkthroughs (e.g., Ippsec) to see different approaches and fill knowledge gaps.
- **[[Continuous Learning]]:** The field evolves rapidly; dedicate time to ongoing practice and learning.
