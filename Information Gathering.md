This is a core phase in [[Penetration Testing]], starting after the [[Pre-Engagement Phase]] is complete and contracts are signed. 

**Information gathering is the most frequent and vital phase throughout the penetration testing process, to which we will return again and again.**

## Goal

Collect as much information as possible about the target environment. All subsequent actions ([[Vulnerability Assessment]], [[Exploitation]], [[Post-Exploitation]], [[Lateral Movement]]) are based on the information gathered here.

## Importance

Information is key. It helps in:
- Identifying potential vulnerabilities.
- Understanding the target's infrastructure and security posture.
- Planning attack vectors.
- Avoiding detection (if required by [[Evasive Testing]] parameters).

## Categories

Typically divided into four main categories:

- [[Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)]]
- [[Infrastructure Enumeration]]
- [[Service Enumeration]]
- [[Host Enumeration]]

All four *should* be used during each pentest.

*Note: Information Gathering also occurs during [[Post-Exploitation]] and [[Lateral Movement]], but with a different perspective (internal vs. external) and potentially different tools/techniques.*
