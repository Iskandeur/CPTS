An excellent network utility for interacting with TCP/UDP ports. 

It can be used for many things during a pentest. Its primary usage is for connecting to shells, which we'll discuss later in this module. 
In addition to that, `netcat` can be used to connect to any listening port and interact with the service running on that port. For example, `SSH` is programmed to handle connections over port 22 to send all data and keys. We can connect to TCP port 22 with `netcat`:

```shell-session
Iskandeur@htb[/htb]$ netcat 10.10.10.10 22

SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Debian-3
```

As we can see, port 22 sent us its banner, stating that `SSH` is running on it.

This technique is called `[[Banner Grabbing]]`, and can help identify what service is running on a particular port. `Netcat` comes pre-installed in most Linux distributions. We can also download a copy for Windows machines from this [link](https://nmap.org/download.html). There's another Windows alternative to `netcat` coded in PowerShell called [PowerCat](https://github.com/besimorhino/powercat). `Netcat` can also be used to transfer files between machines, as we'll discuss later.

Another similar network utility is [socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat), which has a few features that `netcat` does not support, like forwarding ports and connecting to serial devices. `Socat` can also be used to [upgrade a shell to a fully interactive TTY](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/#method-2-using-socat). We will see a few examples of this in a later section. `Socat` is a very handy utility that should be a part of every penetration tester's toolkit. A [standalone binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries) of `Socat` can be transferred to a system after obtaining remote code execution to get a more stable reverse shell connection.
