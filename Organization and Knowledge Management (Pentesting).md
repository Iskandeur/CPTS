Effective organization and knowledge management are crucial for efficient and successful penetration testing.

## Importance

- **Efficiency:** Quickly find necessary information, commands, or payloads during an assessment.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure correct data (scope, findings, evidence) is captured and reported.
- **[[Documentation Skills|Reporting]]:** Organized notes and data are the foundation for high-quality reports.
- **[[Cleanup]]:** Facilitates tracking artifacts that need removal post-engagement.
- **[[Continuous Learning]]:** A structured knowledge base aids learning and retention.
- **Consistency:** Helps maintain a consistent methodology across engagements.

## Key Components

### Folder Structure

- Maintain a clear, consistent directory structure on the attack machine for each project/engagement.
- **Example:**
    ```shell
    ~/Projects/
    └── Client_Name/
        ├── Assessment_Type_1 (e.g., EPT, IPT, WebApp)/
        │   ├── scope/         # Target lists, RoE docs
        │   ├── scans/         # Nmap, vulnerability scanner output
        │   ├── tools/         # Custom scripts, specific tool versions
        │   ├── logs/          # Tool logs, command history
        │   ├── evidence/      # Screenshots, data captures
        │   │   ├── credentials/
        │   │   └── sensitive_data/
        │   └── notes/         # Note-taking tool files
        └── Assessment_Type_2/
            └── ...
    ```
- *Adapt structure based on personal preference and engagement type. Some organize notes/evidence per host within these structures.*

### [[Note-Taking Tools]]

- Use a dedicated tool for capturing detailed notes during the assessment.
- **Essential Features:** Searchability, formatting (code blocks, headings, links), organization (notebooks, tags), potential for embedding images.
- **Popular Options:**
    - [[Obsidian]] (Used by the user)
    - [[Cherrytree]]
    - [[Visual Studio Code]] (with Markdown extensions)
    - [[Notion]]
    - [[GitBook]]
    - [[Evernote]]
    - [[Sublime Text]]
    - [[Notepad++]] (Windows)
- *Experiment to find what works best for individual workflow.*

### [[Knowledge Base (Personal)]]

- Actively maintain a personal repository of useful information.
- **Contents:**
    - Cheat sheets (common commands for tools like [[Nmap]], [[Metasploit]], enumeration scripts).
    - Payloads (reverse shells, exploit snippets).
    - Setup guides/checklists (VM setup, tool installation).
    - Report templates.
    - Findings database (common vulnerability descriptions, impact statements, remediation advice, references) - *Saves significant time during [[Reporting]]*.
    - Notes from past training, labs ([[Hack The Box (HTB)]]), or assessments.
- **Benefits:** Increases speed and efficiency, reduces repetitive searching, aids [[Continuous Learning]].

> TL;DR: Keeping your own knowledge base makes you gain considerable time.
