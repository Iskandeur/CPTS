Alias: [[HTB]]

A popular online platform providing virtual labs and machines for cybersecurity training and [[Practice (Pentesting)|Practice]].

## Resources for Practice (as mentioned in CPTS material)

- **Modules (Academy):** Structured learning content covering specific topics. Recommended practice involves:
    1. Reading the module.
    2. Doing exercises.
    3. Completing the module.
    4. Redoing exercises from scratch while taking detailed notes.
    5. Creating technical and non-technical documentation from notes (aids [[Documentation Skills]]).
- **Retired Machines:** Machines previously active on the main platform, now available for practice (often requires VIP subscription for non-rotated machines).
    - **Advantage:** Official and community write-ups are available for comparison.
    - **Recommended Practice:**
        1. Solve (user and root) independently.
        2. Write technical & non-technical documentation.
        3. Compare with official/community write-ups.
        4. Identify missed steps/information.
        5. Watch video walkthroughs (e.g., Ippsec) for different perspectives.
        6. Update personal notes/documentation.
    - Recommended progression: Start with Easy, move to Medium difficulty.
- **Active Machines:** Currently live machines on the main platform.
    - **Advantage:** Simulates a black-box scenario as no official write-ups are available until retirement.
    - **Recommended Practice:**
        1. Solve (user and root).
        2. Write technical & non-technical documentation.
        3. Get documentation proofread by others for feedback.
    - Recommended progression: Mix Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties.
- **Pro Labs / Endgames:** Large, multi-host environments simulating enterprise networks.
    - **Focus:** Practicing [[Lateral Movement]], [[Pivoting]], [[Active Directory]] attacks, interacting systems, attack chain documentation.
    - Bridge the gap between single-box CTFs and real-world assessments.

## Value

- Provides hands-on experience with diverse systems and vulnerabilities.
- Offers a structured way to progress skills.
- Encourages development of [[Documentation Skills]].
- Simulates aspects of real-world penetration tests (especially Pro Labs).
