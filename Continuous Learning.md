An essential mindset and activity for cybersecurity professionals, especially penetration testers.

## Rationale

- **Rapidly Evolving Field:** Information technology and cybersecurity change constantly.
- **New Threats:** New vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures ([[TTPs]]) emerge frequently.
- **Evolving Defenses:** Security products and strategies improve, requiring attackers to adapt.
- **Maintaining Effectiveness:** Stagnation leads to outdated skills and reduced effectiveness in identifying and exploiting modern vulnerabilities.

## Methods

- **[[Practice (Pentesting)|Consistent Practice]]:** Regularly engage with platforms like [[Hack The Box (HTB)]] or build personal labs.
- **Stay Updated:** Follow security news, blogs, research papers, and conference talks (e.g., DEF CON, Black Hat).
- **Learn New Technologies:** Explore emerging areas like cloud security, container security, IoT, OT.
- **Master Fundamentals:** Continuously reinforce core concepts (networking, OS internals, web protocols).
- **Challenge Yourself:** Don't stick to comfort zones; tackle harder machines, learn new tools, explore unfamiliar attack vectors.
- **Community Involvement:** Participate in forums, Discord servers, local meetups.
- **Formal Training:** Pursue certifications or courses (like CPTS!) to structure learning.
- **Self-Reflection:** Analyze successes and failures during practice or engagements to identify areas for improvement.

## Mindset

- **Curiosity:** A genuine interest in how things work and how they can be broken.
- **Persistence:** Overcoming challenges and roadblocks during learning and testing.
- **Adaptability:** Willingness to learn new tools and techniques as the landscape changes.
- **"Think Outside The Box":** Creative problem-solving to find unconventional solutions.

> Never stop learning and improving. Challenge yourself daily. Take breaks. Enjoy the journey!
