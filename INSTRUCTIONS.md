* Apply formatting on all the #new documents (tagged this way)
* Incorporate them into the knowledge-base, meaning that they have to be connected to AND from other objects if it makes sense
* 


The pages tagged by #new are still to be incorporated in the vault. What I mean by that is:
- Correct orthograph, make slight improvements in formulation or grammar without totally replacing the original essence of my redacting.
- Apply formatting according to [[FORMATTING]].
- Add links TO this note and FROM this note, meaning links and backlin
- Then remove their #new status.
