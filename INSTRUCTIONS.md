The pages tagged by #new are still to be incorporated in the vault (excepted the template and README). What I mean by that is:
- Move them in the Notes folder using CLI commands.
- If some piece of data is really out of place, move it to a host note better suited for it. Try to generally avoid for the same data to be stored in multiple places.
	- Therefore, before incorporating the #new page to the vault, check if some data from the vault can be better placed in it, or if some data in the #new page would be better in a different location.
- Correct orthograph, make slight improvements in formulation or grammar without totally replacing the original essence of my redacting.
- Apply formatting according to [[FORMATTING]].*
- Spontanously create if needed new pages for objects which are in both the new page and the remaining vault, or for objects which are newly addressed by the new page, but presumably will later be referenced again. If linking suggests a new core concept note is needed, create a basic stub for it in the `Notes` directory.
- Add internal links to correctly integrate the note into the knowledge base:
    - **Outgoing Links:** Link relevant keywords or concepts within *this* note to *other existing* or newly created stub notes.
    - **Incoming Links (Backlinks):** After processing the note (formatting, adding outgoing links, moving), automatically search the vault (primarily the `Notes` directory) for mentions of the core concept(s) in the processed note. Add incoming links (`[[wikilinks]]`) back to the processed note from those relevant existing notes.
- Then remove their #new status.

 "Do not put [[]] links in backticks, as in Obsidian it will not be recognized as such."
 Check this rule from FORMATTING is being consistently applied among the whole repository.
