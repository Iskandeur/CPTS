The pages tagged by #new are still to be incorporated in the vault (excepted the template and README). What I mean by that is:
- Correct orthograph, make slight improvements in formulation or grammar without totally replacing the original essence of my redacting.
- Apply formatting according to [[FORMATTING]].
- Add internal links to correctly integrate the note into the knowledge base:
    - **Outgoing Links:** Link relevant keywords or concepts within *this* note to *other existing* notes.
    - **Incoming Links (Backlinks):** Search the vault for *other existing* notes that mention concepts relevant to *this* note and add links back *to this* note.
- Then remove their #new status.
