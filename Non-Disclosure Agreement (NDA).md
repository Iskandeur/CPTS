A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is a secrecy contract between the client and the contractor regarding all written or verbal information concerning an order/project.

## Purpose

## Key Clauses

- Exceptions to confidentiality
- Transferability of rights and obligations
- Contractual penalties

## Timing

The NDA should be signed `before` the [[Kick-Off Meeting]] or at the latest during the meeting before any detailed information is discussed.

## Types

- **Unilateral:** Only one party maintains confidentiality.
- **Bilateral:** Both parties maintain confidentiality (most common for pentesting).
- **Multilateral:** Multiple parties maintain confidentiality (e.g., cooperative networks).
