# Practice

All theory is good but if we have no practice it's useless.
Practice makes perfect / Le talent vient avec l'entraÃ®nement

Penetration testing is fun. We get to attack a network and act like real-world hackers for a period of time. What some people may find boring, however, is an essential part: thorough documentation and strong reporting skills. A client won't be able to do much with a vague two-page report (the same way a two-section module wouldn't do you much good). If we were contracted by a Fortune 500 company and able to take control of their entire domain without triggering an alarm, we'll need to be able to prove it. If we can't back up our assertions with clear evidence, we'll lose credibility, and our work will be called into question.

But if it's too long our hard work will not be well-received.

>Note: When working on a pentest team, we would often practice client kickoff calls and report review meetings with each other. We practiced reviewing the results and drilled each other on our report content and the recommendations we gave to our clients. When our clients asked questions or disputed our recommendations, we were prepared to handle the situation and could answer clearly on the spot as to why we would recommend a specific fix. This type of practice will surely give you a more polished and professional look.

Ideally, practice on environments which match your client's
## Practicing Steps
The numbers below are a good starting example:
- 2x Modules
- 3x Retired Machines
- 5x Active Machines
- 1x Pro Lab / Endgame
#### Modules
The modules chosen should be categorized according to `two different difficulties`: `technical` and `offensive`.

|**Step**|**Task**|
|---|---|
|1.|Read the module|
|2.|Practice the exercises|
|3.|Complete the module|
|4.|Start the module exercises from scratch|
|5.|While solving the exercises again, take notes|
|6.|Create technical documentation based on the notes|
|7.|Create non-technical documentation based on the notes|

These notes will be quite valuable as we move along in our careers. Some pairings of technologies and attack vectors can be rare to see in the wild, so having detailed notes about those systems from when you interacted with them will help you progress through an assessment quicker where you encounter them.
