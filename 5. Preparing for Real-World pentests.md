# Practice

All theory is good but if we have no practice it's useless.
Practice makes perfect / Le talent vient avec l'entraÃ®nement

Penetration testing is fun. We get to attack a network and act like real-world hackers for a period of time. What some people may find boring, however, is an essential part: thorough documentation and strong reporting skills. A client won't be able to do much with a vague two-page report (the same way a two-section module wouldn't do you much good). If we were contracted by a Fortune 500 company and able to take control of their entire domain without triggering an alarm, we'll need to be able to prove it. If we can't back up our assertions with clear evidence, we'll lose credibility, and our work will be called into question.

But if it's too long our hard work will not be well-received.

>Note: When working on a pentest team, we would often practice client kickoff calls and report review meetings with each other. We practiced reviewing the results and drilled each other on our report content and the recommendations we gave to our clients. When our clients asked questions or disputed our recommendations, we were prepared to handle the situation and could answer clearly on the spot as to why we would recommend a specific fix. This type of practice will surely give you a more polished and professional look.
