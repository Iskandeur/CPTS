The goal of this repository is to store important information, or any stuff I find interesting in my CPTS journey.

See [[FORMATTING]] for documentation standards.

## Structure

This vault uses an object-based structure. Each note represents a specific concept, tool, technique, or process related to penetration testing.
Files about meta-topics (such as formatting) have their name capslocked.

Key starting points:

- [[Penetration Testing Process]] - Overview of the stages.
- [[Information Security (Infosec)]] - Foundational concepts.
- [[Laws and Regulations (Cybersecurity)]] - Legal and ethical context.

## Vault Restructuring Plan (Completed)

The vault has been restructured based on user request. The goal was to move from a chapter-based organization to an **object-based structure**.

This means creating dedicated notes for individual concepts, tools, techniques, or entities (e.g., `Ports.md`, `Nmap.md`, `Scope Questionnaire.md`, `Active Directory.md`, `Kerberos.md`, etc.).

**Benefits:**

*   **Granularity:** Easier to find and update specific pieces of information.
*   **Incremental Learning:** Facilitates adding details to the correct note as they are learned, rather than just copying large chunks.
*   **Linking:** Encourages linking related concepts together, building a knowledge graph.

**Process:**

1.  Identify key objects/concepts from the existing notes and the formation material.
2.  Create new markdown files for each object.
3.  **Migrate relevant information from the old structure to the new object files, ensuring existing data finds its place.**
4.  **Interlink related concepts using Obsidian's `[[WikiLink]]` format.**
5.  Update old links if necessary.

This approach aims to make the vault a more dynamic and useful personal knowledge base throughout the CPTS journey.
