Another similar network utility is [socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat), which has a few features that `netcat` does not support, like forwarding ports and connecting to serial devices. `Socat` can also be used to [upgrade a shell to a fully interactive TTY](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/#method-2-using-socat). We will see a few examples of this in a later section. `Socat` is a very handy utility that should be a part of every penetration tester's toolkit. A [standalone binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries) of `Socat` can be transferred to a system after obtaining remote code execution to get a more stable reverse shell connection.
