## Getting Started with a Pentest Distro
As penetration testers, we must understand how to set up, maintain, and secure both Linux and Windows attack machines.
### Choosing a Distro
No distro has all needed.
As we learn and progress in our careers, we will gravitate to specific tools and have a list of "must-haves" to add to a new distro. As we progress, we may even prefer to fully customize our own pentesting VM from a Debian or Ubuntu base image, but building a fully custom VM is outside this module's scope.

This section will cover setting up and working with [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/). This distro is used for the Pwnbox that we will see throughout Academy, customized to practice and solve exercises throughout the various modules we will encounter.

It is important to note that each penetration test or security assessment must be performed from a freshly installed VM to avoid including security-relevant details from another client environment in our reports by accident or retaining client-sensitive data for significant lengths of time. For this reason, we must have the ability to quickly stand up a new pentest machine and have processes in place (automation, scripts, detailed procedures, etc.) for quickly setting up our distro(s) of choice for each assessment we perform.

### Setting Up a Pentest Distro

There are many ways to set up our local pentest distro. We can
- install it as our base operating system (though not recommended), 
- configure our workstation to dual boot (time-consuming to switch back and forth between operating systems), 
- or install using virtualization.

A `hypervisor` is software that allows us to create and run virtual machines (VMs).

Everyone working in a technical information security role should be comfortable working with one or more hypervisors and building virtual machines competently for both work and practice.

For parrotOS (pwnbox);
#### ISO
The `ISO` file is essentially just a CD-ROM that can be mounted within our hypervisor of choice to build the VM by installing the operating system ourselves. An `ISO` gives us more room for customization, e.g., keyboard layout, locale, desktop environment switch, custom partitioning, etc., and therefore a more granular approach when setting up our attack VM.
#### OVA
The `OVA` file is a pre-built virtual appliance that contains an `OVF` XML file that specifies the VM hardware settings and a `VMDK`, which is the virtual disk that the operating system is installed on. An `OVA` is pre-built and therefore can be rapidly deployed to get up and running quicker.

### Practicing with Parrot
The in-browser version, or Pwnbox, is available in any module sections which require interaction with a target host in our lab environment. Click the `Start Instance` button below and start becoming familiar with the Pwnbox. All interactive Module sections can be completed from our own VM after either spawning a Docker image or spawning a target host or multiple hosts and downloading a VPN key. Using the Pwnbox is not a requirement but is useful because all Academy work can be completed within our browser without requiring any virtualization software or additional resources to run a virtual machine.

Docker instances can be accessed without requiring a separate VPN connection. Specific hosts (i.e., Active Directory targets) require VPN access if not accessed from the Pwnbox. If this is the case, a button will appear to download a VPN key after spawning the target. We will begin working with target hosts later in this module.

## Staying Organized
