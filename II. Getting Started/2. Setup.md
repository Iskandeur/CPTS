## Getting Started with a Pentest Distro
As penetration testers, we must understand how to set up, maintain, and secure both Linux and Windows attack machines.
### Choosing a Distro
No distro has all needed.
As we learn and progress in our careers, we will gravitate to specific tools and have a list of "must-haves" to add to a new distro. As we progress, we may even prefer to fully customize our own pentesting VM from a Debian or Ubuntu base image, but building a fully custom VM is outside this module's scope.

This section will cover setting up and working with [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/). This distro is used for the Pwnbox that we will see throughout Academy, customized to practice and solve exercises throughout the various modules we will encounter.

It is important to note that each penetration test or security assessment must be performed from a freshly installed VM to avoid including security-relevant details from another client environment in our reports by accident or retaining client-sensitive data for significant lengths of time. For this reason, we must have the ability to quickly stand up a new pentest machine and have processes in place (automation, scripts, detailed procedures, etc.) for quickly setting up our distro(s) of choice for each assessment we perform.

### Setting Up a Pentest Distro

There are many ways to set up our local pentest distro. We can
- install it as our base operating system (though not recommended), 
- configure our workstation to dual boot (time-consuming to switch back and forth between operating systems), 
- or install using virtualization.
- 
A `hypervisor` is software that allows us to create and run virtual machines (VMs).
