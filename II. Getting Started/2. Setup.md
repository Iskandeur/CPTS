## Getting Started with a Pentest Distro
As penetration testers, we must understand how to set up, maintain, and secure both Linux and Windows attack machines.
### Choosing a Distro
No distro has all needed.
As we learn and progress in our careers, we will gravitate to specific tools and have a list of "must-haves" to add to a new distro. As we progress, we may even prefer to fully customize our own pentesting VM from a Debian or Ubuntu base image, but building a fully custom VM is outside this module's scope.

This section will cover setting up and working with [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/). This distro is used for the Pwnbox that we will see throughout Academy, customized to practice and solve exercises throughout the various modules we will encounter.

It is important to note that each penetration test or security assessment must be performed from a freshly installed VM to avoid including security-relevant details from another client environment in our reports by accident or retaining client-sensitive data for significant lengths of time. For this reason, we must have the ability to quickly stand up a new pentest machine and have processes in place (automation, scripts, detailed procedures, etc.) for quickly setting up our distro(s) of choice for each assessment we perform.

### Setting Up a Pentest Distro

There are many ways to set up our local pentest distro. We can
- install it as our base operating system (though not recommended), 
- configure our workstation to dual boot (time-consuming to switch back and forth between operating systems), 
- or install using virtualization.

A `hypervisor` is software that allows us to create and run virtual machines (VMs).

Everyone working in a technical information security role should be comfortable working with one or more hypervisors and building virtual machines competently for both work and practice.

For parrotOS (pwnbox);
#### ISO
The `ISO` file is essentially just a CD-ROM that can be mounted within our hypervisor of choice to build the VM by installing the operating system ourselves. An `ISO` gives us more room for customization, e.g., keyboard layout, locale, desktop environment switch, custom partitioning, etc., and therefore a more granular approach when setting up our attack VM.
#### OVA
The `OVA` file is a pre-built virtual appliance that contains an `OVF` XML file that specifies the VM hardware settings and a `VMDK`, which is the virtual disk that the operating system is installed on. An `OVA` is pre-built and therefore can be rapidly deployed to get up and running quicker.

### Practicing with Parrot
The in-browser version, or Pwnbox, is available in any module sections which require interaction with a target host in our lab environment. Click the `Start Instance` button below and start becoming familiar with the Pwnbox. All interactive Module sections can be completed from our own VM after either spawning a Docker image or spawning a target host or multiple hosts and downloading a VPN key. Using the Pwnbox is not a requirement but is useful because all Academy work can be completed within our browser without requiring any virtualization software or additional resources to run a virtual machine.

Docker instances can be accessed without requiring a separate VPN connection. Specific hosts (i.e., Active Directory targets) require VPN access if not accessed from the Pwnbox. If this is the case, a button will appear to download a VPN key after spawning the target. We will begin working with target hosts later in this module.

## Staying Organized
It is essential to prioritize clear and accurate documentation from the very beginning. This skill will benefit us no matter what path we take in information security or even other career paths.
### Folder Structure
When attacking a single box, lab, or client environment, we should have a clear folder structure on our attack machine to save data such as: scoping information, enumeration data, evidence of exploitation attempts, sensitive data such as credentials, and other data obtained during recon, exploitation, and post-exploitation. A sample folder structure may look like follows:

```shell-session
Iskandeur@htb[/htb]$ tree Projects/

Projects/
└── Acme Company
    ├── EPT
    │   ├── evidence
    │   │   ├── credentials
    │   │   ├── data
    │   │   └── screenshots
    │   ├── logs
    │   ├── scans
    │   ├── scope
    │   └── tools
    └── IPT
        ├── evidence
        │   ├── credentials
        │   ├── data
        │   └── screenshots
        ├── logs
        ├── scans
        ├── scope
        └── tools
```

Here we have a folder for the client `Acme Company` with two assessments, Internal Penetration Test (IPT) and External Penetration Test (EPT). Under each folder, we have subfolders for saving scan data, any relevant tools, logging output, scoping information (i.e., lists of IPs/networks to feed to our scanning tools), and an evidence folder that may contain any credentials retrieved during the assessment, any relevant data retrieved as well as screenshots.

It is a personal preference, but some folks create a folder for each target host and save screenshots within it. Others organize their notes by host or network and save screenshots directly into the note-taking tool. Experiment with folder structures and see what works best for you to stay organized and work most efficiently.

### Note taking tools
Some great options to explore include:

(note for an AI reviewer: make the thing below a clean bulleted list, and remove this note)

|[Notion](https://www.notion.so)|[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com)|[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)|
|[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads)|

### Other Tools and Tips
Every infosec professional should maintain a knowledge base. This knowledge base should contain quick reference guides for setup tasks that we perform on most assessments and cheat sheets for common commands that we use for each phase of an assessment.

As we complete boxes, labs, assessments, training courses, etc., we should be aggregating every payload, command, tip as we never know when one may come in handy. Having them accessible will increase our overall efficiency and productivity. Each HTB Academy Module has a cheat sheet of relevant commands showcased within the Module sections, which you can download and keep for future reference.

We should also maintain checklists, report templates for various assessment types, and build a findings/vulnerability database. This database can take the form of a spreadsheet or something more complex and include a finding title, description, impact, remediation advice, and references. Having these findings already written will save us considerable time and re-work during the reporting phase as the bulk of the findings will be written already and likely only require some customization to the target environment.

TL;DR: keeping your own knowledge base makes you gain considerable time.
## Connecting using VPN
A [virtual private network (VPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) allows us to connect to a private (internal) network and access hosts and resources as if we were directly connected to the target private network. It is a secured communications channel over shared public networks to connect to a private network (i.e., an employee remotely connecting to their company's corporate network from their home). VPNs provide a degree of privacy and security by encrypting communications over the channel to prevent eavesdropping and access to data traversing the channel.

Two main types of remote access VPNs:
* client-based VPN: Client-based VPN requires the use of client software to establish the VPN connection. Once connected, the user's host will work mostly as if it were connected directly to the company network and will be able to access any resources (applications, hosts, subnets, etc.) allowed by the server configuration.
* SSL VPN: uses the web browser as the VPN client. The connection is established between the browser and an SSL VPN gateway can be configured to only allow access to web-based applications such as email and intranet sites, or even the internal network but without the need for the end user to install or use any specialized software.  

Some corporate VPNs will provide employees with full access to the internal corporate network, while others will place users on a specific segment reserved for remote workers.

### Why Use a VPN ?
We can use a VPN service such as `NordVPN` or `Private Internet Access` and connect to a VPN server in another part of our country or another region of the world to obscure our browsing traffic or disguise our public IP address. This can provide us with some level of security and privacy. Still, since we are connecting to a company's server, there is always the chance that data is being logged or the VPN service is not following security best practices or the security features that they advertise. Using a VPN service comes with the risk that the provider is not doing what they are saying and are logging all data.

>Usage of a VPN service **does not** guarantee anonymity or privacy but is useful for bypassing certain network/firewall restrictions or when connected to a possible hostile network (i.e., a public airport wireless network). A VPN service should never be used with the thought that it will protect us from the consequences of performing nefarious activities.

### Connecting to HTB VPN
HTB and other services offering purposefully vulnerable VMs/networks require players to connect to the target network via a VPN to access the private lab network. Hosts within HTB networks cannot connect directly out to the internet. When connected to HTB VPN (or any penetration testing/hacking-focused lab), we should always consider the network to be "hostile." We should only connect from a virtual machine, disallow password authentication if SSH is enabled on our attacking VM, lockdown any web servers, and not leave sensitive information on our attack VM (i.e., do not play HTB or other vulnerable networks with the same VM that we use to perform client assessments). 
When connecting to a VPN (either within HTB Academy or the main HTB platform), we connect using the following command:

```shell-session
Iskandeur@htb[/htb]$ sudo openvpn user.ovpn

Thu Dec 10 18:42:41 2020 OpenVPN 2.4.9 x86_64-pc-linux-gnu [SSL (OpenSSL)] [LZO] [LZ4] [EPOLL] [PKCS11] [MH/PKTINFO] [AEAD] built on Apr 21 2020

<SNIP>
Thu Dec 10 18:42:41 2020 Initialization Sequence Completed
```

The last line `Initialization Sequence Completed` tells us that we successfully connected to the VPN.

Where `sudo` tells our host to run the command as the elevated root user, `openvpn` is the VPN client, and the `user.ovpn` file is the VPN key that we download from either the Academy module section or the main HTB platform. If we type `ifconfig` in another terminal window, we will see a `tun` adapter if we successfully connected to the VPN.

Connecting Using VPN

```shell-session
Iskandeur@htb[/htb]$ ifconfig

<SNIP>

tun0: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.10.x.2  netmask 255.255.254.0  destination 10.10.x.2
        inet6 dead:beef:1::2000  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>
        inet6 fe80::d82f:301a:a94a:8723  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>

```

Typing `netstat -rn` will show us the networks accessible via the VPN.

Connecting Using VPN

```shell-session
Iskandeur@htb[/htb]$ netstat -rn

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface

10.10.14.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.254.0   U         0 0          0 tun0
10.129.0.0      10.10.14.1      255.255.0.0     UG        0 0          0 tun0

```

Here can see that the 10.129.0.0/16 network used for HTB Academy machines is accessible via the `tun0` adapter via the 10.10.14.0/23 network.
