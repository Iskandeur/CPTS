### What is a Shell?
Has a few meanings.

In a Linux system, the shell is a program that takes input from the user via the keyboard and passes these commands to the operating system to perform a specific function. 

_In the early days of computing, the shell was the only interface available for interacting with systems. Since then, many more operating system types and versions have emerged along with the graphic user interface (GUI) to complement command-line interfaces (shell), such as the Linux terminal, Windows command-line (cmd.exe), and Windows PowerShell._

Most Linux systems use a program called [Bash (Bourne Again Shell)](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html) as a shell program to interact with the operating system. Bash is an enhanced version of [sh](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sh.1p.html), the Unix systems' original shell program. Aside from `bash` there are also other shells, including but not limited to [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), [Tcsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcsh), [Ksh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell), [Fish shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_\(Unix_shell\)), etc.
