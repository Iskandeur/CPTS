## Common Terms
### What is a Shell?
Has a few meanings.

In a Linux system, the shell is a program that takes input from the user via the keyboard and passes these commands to the operating system to perform a specific function. 

_In the early days of computing, the shell was the only interface available for interacting with systems. Since then, many more operating system types and versions have emerged along with the graphic user interface (GUI) to complement command-line interfaces (shell), such as the Linux terminal, Windows command-line (cmd.exe), and Windows PowerShell._

Most Linux systems use a program called [Bash (Bourne Again Shell)](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html) as a shell program to interact with the operating system. Bash is an enhanced version of [sh](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sh.1p.html), the Unix systems' original shell program. Aside from `bash` there are also other shells, including but not limited to [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), [Tcsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcsh), [Ksh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell), [Fish shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_\(Unix_shell\)), etc.

Bourne-Again SHell: joke originating from Stephen Bourne, the shell creator.

#### Getting a shell
We will often read about or hear others talking about "getting a shell" on a box (system). This means that the target host has been exploited, and we have obtained shell-level access (typically `bash` or `sh`) and can run commands interactively as if we are sitting logged in to the host. A shell may be obtained by exploiting a web application or network/service vulnerability or obtaining credentials and logging into the target host remotely. There are three main types of shell connections:

|**Shell Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Reverse shell`|Initiates a connection back to a "listener" on our attack box.|
|`Bind shell`|"Binds" to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box.|
|`Web shell`|Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive. It can also be used to run single commands (i.e., leveraging a file upload vulnerability and uploading a `PHP` script to run a single command.|

Each type of shell has its use case, and the same way there are many ways to obtain a shell, the helper program that we use to get a shell can be written in many languages (`Python`, `Perl`, `Go`, `Bash`, `Java`, `awk`, `PHP`, etc.). These can be small scripts or larger, more complex programs to facilitate a connection from the target host back to our attacking system and obtain "shell" access. Shell access will be discussed in-depth in a later section.

### What is a Port?
A [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_\(computer_networking\)) can be thought of as a window or door on a house (the house being a remote system), if a window or door is left open or not locked correctly, we can often gain unauthorized access to a home. This is similar in computing. Ports are virtual points where network connections begin and end. They are software-based and managed by the host operating system. Ports are associated with a specific process or service and allow computers to differentiate between different traffic types (SSH traffic flows to a different port than web requests to access a website even though the access requests are sent over the same network connection).
