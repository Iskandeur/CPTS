## [[Information Security (Infosec)]] Overview

*   [[Information Security (Infosec)|Infosec]] is the broad practice of protecting data ([[CIA Triad]]).
*   It involves many specializations, including security testing like [[Penetration Testing]].

## [[Risk Management (Cybersecurity)]]

*   Organizations use a [[Risk Management (Cybersecurity)|Risk Management Process]] (Identify, Analyze, Evaluate, Treat, Monitor) to protect assets.
*   Pentesting is a key input into this process.

## [[Red Team vs Blue Team]]

*   Red Teams simulate attackers.
*   Blue Teams defend the organization.
*   See also [[Penetration Test vs Red Team vs VA]] and [[Purple Teaming]].

## Role of [[Penetration Testers]]

*   Help organizations identify risks ([[Vulnerability Assessment (VA)]], misconfigurations, etc.).
*   Provide reproducible findings and remediation guidance (see [[Reporting]]).
*   Assessments can take many forms (e.g., [[White Box Testing]], [[Red Teaming]] scenarios).
