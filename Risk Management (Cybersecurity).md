The broader business context in which [[Penetration Testing]] often operates.

## Definition

The overall strategy and process an organization uses to manage potential threats to its information systems and data.

## Goal

- **Identify:** Recognize potential risks and vulnerabilities.
- **Evaluate:** Assess the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks.
- **Mitigate:** Implement controls and take actions (like patching, configuration changes, security awareness training) to reduce risks to an acceptable level.
- **Protect:** Ensure the [[CIA Triad|Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability]] of information systems and data.

## [[CIA Triad]]

- **[[Confidentiality]]:** Ensuring information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.
- **[[Integrity]]:** Maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle. Preventing unauthorized modification or deletion.
- **[[Availability]]:** Ensuring systems and data are accessible and usable upon demand by authorized users.

## Role of Penetration Testing

- **Identify Risks:** [[Penetration Test]]ing actively seeks out vulnerabilities that pose risks.
- **Evaluate Risks:** By demonstrating exploitability ([[Exploitation]]) and potential impact ([[Post-Exploitation]], [[Lateral Movement]]), pentesting provides crucial data for evaluating the *actual* risk posed by a vulnerability, beyond theoretical assessments.
- **Validate Mitigation:** [[Post-Remediation Testing]] helps validate whether mitigation efforts were successful.
- **Inform Mitigation:** Findings directly inform prioritization and selection of mitigation strategies.

## Risk Treatment Options

Besides mitigation, organizations might also:
- **Accept Risk:** If the cost of mitigation outweighs the potential impact, or the risk is very low.
- **Transfer Risk:** Shift risk to a third party (e.g., through insurance, outsourcing to a provider with contractual guarantees).
- **Avoid Risk:** Discontinue the activity or system associated with the risk.
